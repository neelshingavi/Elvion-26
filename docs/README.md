# FounderFlow - The Agentic Startup Operating System

**FounderFlow** is a comprehensive, AI-powered operating system designed to guide entrepreneurs from the "back of the napkin" stage to a fully operational startup. It acts as a virtual co-founder, providing structure, validation, and execution support to chaotic early-stage ventures.

## 💡 Introduction

**What is FounderFlow?**
Building a startup is overwhelming. Founders juggle idea validation, roadmap planning, legal compliance, and daily execution—often without guidance. **FounderFlow** solves this by integrating AI agents directly into the workflow. It's not just a project management tool; it's an intelligent system that _understands_ your business idea and actively helps you build it.

**Who is this for?**

- **Early-stage Founders**: Who need clarity and structure.
- **Solo Entrepreneurs**: Who need a virtual team to validate and plan.
- **Incubators**: Who need to track and support multiple portfolio companies.

**Why does it exist?**
To reduce the failure rate of startups by ensuring every idea is market-validated, structured, and roadmap-driven before significant capital is burnt.

## 🚶 The User Journey

1.  **Authentication**:
    The user arrives at the landing page and logs in via Google or Email/Password. If they are new, they sign up, and a secure account is created.

2.  **Onboarding (The "Zero to One" Step)**:
    The user is prompted to create a **Project Workspace**. They input their startup's name, industry, and a rough problem statement. This scopes all future AI interactions to this specific context.

3.  **The Dashboard**:
    The user lands on the **Founder Dashboard**, a central command center showing their startup's health, stage, and recent activities.

4.  **Idea Validation**:
    The user submits detailed aspects of their idea. An **AI Agent** analyzes it against real-world market constraints (specifically localized for India), providing a viability score, cost estimates, and risk analysis.

5.  **Execution & Tasks**:
    Based on the validation, the system (via AI) generates a list of "Atomic Tasks"—small, actionable steps to move the project forward. The user manages these on a Kanban board.

## ✨ Core Features

### 1. **AI Idea Validation Agent**

- **What it does:** deep-dives into a startup concept.
- **Function:** Generates a viability score (0-100), estimates initial capital requirements (in INR), identifies competitors, and suggests pivots.
- **Interaction:** User inputs text; AI returns a structured report saved to "Startup Memory".
- **Export:** Download detailed AI analysis reports as PDF for offline review.

### 2. **Startup Memory**

- **What it does:** Acts as the "brain" of the project.
- **Function:** An append-only log of every major decision, pivot, and AI insight.
- **Value:** Ensures context isn't lost. Future agents read this memory to give better advice.

### 3. **Smart Task Management**

- **What it does:** A Kanban-style board for execution.
- **Function:** Tasks can be manually created or **auto-generated by AI** based on the current startup stage.
- **Interaction:** Drag-and-drop interface for "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done".

### 4. **Founder Profile & Networking**

- **What it does:** expansive user profile management.
- **Function:** Tracks founder skills, background, and connected industries to facilitate future matching.

### 5. **Internal Admin System**

- **What it does:** A restricted area for platform administrators.
- **Function:** Allows admins to view all users, manage startups, and oversee platform health.

## 🛠 Technology Stack

### **Frontend**

- **Next.js 16.1 (App Router)**: For high-performance, server-rendered React applications.
- **React 19.2**: The core UI library.
- **TailwindCSS 4**: For a modern, utility-first design system with Dark Mode support.
- **Framer Motion**: For fluid, native-feeling animations and page transitions.
- **Lucide React**: For consistent, clean vector iconography.

### **Backend**

- **Next.js API Routes**: Serverless functions that handle business logic and AI orchestration.
- **Google Gemini Pro & Flash**: The Large Language Model (LLM) powering the intelligence layer.

### **Database**

- **Firebase Firestore**: A NoSQL, real-time database chosen for its flexibility with schema-less startup data.

### **Authentication**

- **Firebase Auth**: Secure, managed authentication for Google and Email/Password flows.

---

## 🏗 System Architecture

The architecture follows a **Service-Oriented** pattern within a Monolith, optimized for the Next.js App Router.

### **1. Client-Server Interaction**

- **UI Layer**: Client components (`"use client"`) handle interactivity (forms, drag-and-drop).
- **Service Layer**: `src/lib/` contains the business logic. It connects to Firestore and ensures rigorous data validation.
- **API Layer**: `src/app/api/` endpoints act as secure gateways for sensitive operations (like calling the AI API) that cannot run on the client.

### **2. Data Flow**

`User Input` -> `Client Component` -> `API Route` -> `AI Agent / Firestore` -> `UI Update`

### **3. AI Orchestration**

- Prompts are constructed dynamically using "Startup Memory" context.
- Responses are enforced into **JSON Schema** to ensure the frontend can render them reliably (no raw text parsing).

## 💾 Database Design

The data model uses **Firestore Collections**.

1.  **`users`**
    - Stores founder profiles (`uid`, `email`, `role`, `activeStartupId`).
    - **Relation**: 1 User -> N Startups (via `startup_members`).

2.  **`startups`**
    - The core entity (`name`, `industry`, `stage`, `ownerId`).
    - **Relation**: 1 Startup -> N Tasks, N Memories.

3.  **`startupMemory`**
    - Immutable logs (`type`, `content`, `timestamp`).
    - Stores AI reports, pivot decisions, and validation results.

4.  **`tasks`**
    - Action items (`title`, `priority`, `status`, `aiResponse`).

5.  **`agentRuns`**
    - Audit logs of when and how AI agents were triggered.

---

## 🔐 Authentication & Security

1.  **Founder Authentication**:
    - Managed via **Firebase Auth**.
    - State is tracked globally via `AuthContext`.
    - Protected routes (`/founder/*`) automatically redirect unauthenticated users to `/login`.

2.  **Admin Authentication**:
    - Uses a separate, secure cookie-based flow (`founderflow_admin_session`).
    - Protected by **Next.js Middleware**.
    - Admin routes (`/admin/*`) are invisible to standard users.

3.  **Data Security**:
    - API Routes validate `startupId` ownership before processing.
    - Input sanitization prevents empty or malicious payloads from hitting the AI.

## 🚀 Setup & Installation

### **Prerequisites**

- **Node.js 18+** installed.
- A **Firebase Project** (Auth & Firestore enabled).
- A **Google Gemini API Key**.

### **Step 1: Clone & Install**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neelshingavi/Founders-Flow.git
cd founderflow
npm install
```

### **Step 2: Environment Variables**

Create a `.env.local` file in the root. **Do not commit this file.**

```env
# Firebase Client SDK
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_bucket
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id

# AI Service
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

# Admin Credentials (for internal portal)
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=secure_password
ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET=long_random_string
```

### **Step 3: Run Locally**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

---

## ☁️ Deployment

The project is optimized for deployment on **Vercel** or **Render**.

- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `.next`
- Ensure all environment variables from `.env.local` are added to your hosting platform's dashboard.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations & Boundaries

- **Payments**: No payment gateway integration (Stripe/Razorpay) is currently implemented.
- **Multi-Tenancy**: While the DB supports it, the UI is significantly optimized for single-project focus per session.
- **Real-Time**: Most features use "fetch-on-load". Real-time socket listeners are limited to specific chat features.

---

## 🔧 Maintenance & Extensibility

- **Adding New Agents**:
  1.  Create a new route in `src/app/api/your-agent/`.
  2.  Define the prompt and JSON schema.
  3.  Call `callGemini()` from `src/lib/gemini.ts`.
  4.  Save the result using `addStartupMemory()`.

- **Updating UI**:
  - Modify `globals.css` for theme changes.
  - Components in `src/components/ui/` are reused across the app; update them to change the global design language.
