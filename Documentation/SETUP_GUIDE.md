z# FounderFlow SETUP GUIDE

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up the FounderFlow project on a new machine.

## 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Node.js**: Version 18.0.0 or higher. [Download here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: (Comes with Node.js) or **Yarn** / **pnpm**.
- **Git**: (Optional, for cloning if hosted on GitHub).

## 2. Project Acquisition

If the project is in a Git repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/neelshingavi/Founder-Flow.git
cd Founder-Flow/founder-flow
```
Or simply copy the `founder-flow` folder to your new desktop.

## 3. Dependency Installation

FounderFlow uses several key libraries for its agentic features and UI. Run the following command in the root of the `founder-flow` directory:

```bash
npm install
```

### What gets installed:
- **Next.js 15+**: The core framework.
- **Firebase SDK**: For Authentication and Firestore Database.
- **@google/generative-ai**: The Gemini API client for AI Agents.
- **Lucide React**: Our premium icon library.
- **Framer Motion**: For smooth UI transitions and animations.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For high-end aesthetics.
- **date-fns**: For timeline logging and timestamp formatting.

## 4. Configuration (Action Required)

You must set up your environment variables for the project to function.

1. Create a file named `.env.local` in the `founder-flow` directory.
2. Refer to `.env.example` for the required keys.
3. Fill in the following details:

### A. Firebase Setup
1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Create a new project named "FounderFlow".
3. Enable **Authentication** (Enable Google and Email/Password providers).
4. Enable **Cloud Firestore** in "Production" or "Test" mode.
5. Create a Web App in the Firebase project settings and copy the `firebaseConfig` object into your `.env.local`.

### B. Gemini AI Setup
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
2. Generate an **API Key**.
3. Add it as `GEMINI_API_KEY` in your `.env.local`.

## 5. Running the Project

Once dependencies are installed and `.env.local` is configured, start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## 6. Troubleshooting

- **Firebase Config Errors**: If the UI shows "Firebase configuration is missing," check that your `.env.local` keys exactly match the variable names in `src/lib/firebase.ts`.
- **Gemini Auth Errors**: Ensure your Gemini API key has sufficient permissions and is not restricted by region.
- **Build Errors**: Clear the cache and reinstall if errors persist:
  ```bash
  rm -rf .next node_modules
  npm install
  ```
